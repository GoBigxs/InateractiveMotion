In our research, we aim to explore the potential of GenAI and motion capture in artistic interactive experiences.
We seek to push the boundaries of artistic innovation and inspire new forms of interactive creation in the digital age.

Leveraging Diffusion for Art Generation
With its ability to generate high-quality images in real-time, Diffusers enables us to create dynamic and visually captivating art works, such as images of flowers, based on motion tracking data.
By integrating Diffusers into our interactive environment, we can leverage its sophisticated diffusion models to produce a wide range of artistic outputs that respond dynamically to user interactions.
Additionally, Diffusers offers extensive control and customization options, allowing us to tailor the generated art works to suit the specific aesthetic preferences and creative objectives of our project.

Balancing Consistency and Controllability
One of the key advantages of Diffusers over StreamDiffusion is its ability to strike a balance between consistency and controllability in generative content. 
While StreamDiffusion aims to faithfully render all elements of a user's prompt in a single draw, Diffusers provides more flexibility and unpredictability in the generation process. 
This allows us to maintain content coherence while also allowing for artistic exploration and variation. 
By carefully managing input parameters and model configurations, we can ensure that the generated art works maintain a consistent aesthetic while still offering a degree of creative freedom and spontaneity to users.
